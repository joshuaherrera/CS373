# CS373 Final Writeup   

### Introduction   
We've reached the end of the course and it is now time for the final. Unlike other classes where students do some form of standardized testing, we get the opportunity to put what we've learned in this class to the test by completing some challenges from the site [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/). HackTheBox is a site used for testing one's penetration testing skills. For the final, we needed to complete a minimum of three challenges, achieving a score of 50 points or more. I ended up doing two stenography challenges and one web challenge to achieve the 50 points. However, to get to that point, I needed to generate an invite code.
