# CS373 Final Writeup   

### Introduction   
We've reached the end of the course and it is now time for the final. Unlike other classes where students do some form of standardized testing, we get the opportunity to put what we've learned in this class to the test by completing some challenges from the site [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/). HackTheBox is a site used for testing one's penetration testing skills. For the final, we needed to complete a minimum of three challenges, achieving a score of 50 points or more. I ended up doing two stenography challenges and one web challenge to achieve the 50 points. However, to get to that point, I needed to generate an invite code.   
### Generating An Invite (5 Points)
When I tried signing up, I realized that it would not be as easy as providing an email and password. Since the site centers around penetration testing, potential users are encouraged to hack their way into the site.   
As I looked through the Chrome Developer Tools, I found an invite javascript file.   
<!-- [![alt text](image link)](web link) -->
   
   [![invite](/CS373/assets/invite_code/inviteapi.png?raw=true "Invite API")](/CS373/assets/invite_code/inviteapi.png?raw=true)   
   
   Looking through that file, I found a function name, makeInviteCode. Calling this from the console yielded a ROT13 encrypted string. This type of encryption rotates each letters 13 characters from it's current position. It seems like I would need to decode this.

Luckily there are sites online that can be used to decrypt such messages. When I put the text into such a site, I found I would need to make a POST request to the site to generate a code.   
   
   [![rot13](/CS373/assets/invite_code/rot13.png?raw=true "ROT13")](/CS373/assets/invite_code/rot13.png?raw=true)   

I used a Chrome app called ARC that was used in the databases class, CS340. With this I was able to generate a new code, however, this code was also encoded in what looked to be base64.

Following the decryption of this code, again using an online site, I was able to generate an invite code and create an account.

### The System Environment   
Before I begin talking about the actual challenges, I'd like to take a moment and speak about the environment I did the challenges on. Normally, I do most of my development on my laptop which has both Windows 10 and Linux Mint dual booted, but HackTheBox recommends creating a virtual machine for the content on there. Therefore, I created a virtual machine using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), mainly because I ran into issues attempting to install VMWare. Once I had this installed, I proceeded to download a copy of [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/), specifically, an image already prepared for use with VirtualBox. For those unaware, Kali is a Linux distribution with many penetration testing applications already installed. It is, arguably, the standard when it comes to penetration testing distributions. With these things installed, I was ready to attempt the challenges.   

### Challenge One: Weak RSA (Crypto, 20 Points)   
The first challenge I decided to do was worth 20 points. It was the weak RSA challenge. For this challenge, I downloaded the zip which contained two files, key.pub and flag.enc. The directions explained that the flag.enc is encrypted with a weak RSA encryption algorithm, and I would be tasked with decrypting it.   
At first this seemed daunting, and I did not know where to start. Since I was using Kali I took to Google and searched to see if Kali had any tools installed that could decrypt and decipher files encrypted with weak RSA keys. I did not find anything preinstalled, however, one of the first results was for [RsaCtfTool](https://github.com/Ganapati/RsaCtfTool) on Github.   
   
   [![rsatool](/CS373/assets/weakrsa/rsa_tool.png?raw=true "RsaCtfTool")](/CS373/assets/weakrsa/rsa_tool.png?raw=true)

A quick look through the readme showed that to uncipher a file one would input:
```
./RsaCtfTool.py --publickey ./key.pub --uncipherfile ./ciphered\_file
```   
Sure enough, when I used that entry the RSA was broken and file was decrypted to give the flag.

I was extremely surprised to see that, using this simple tool, my first challenge was completed. Quite fun I must say.

### Challenge Two: You Can Do It (Crypto, 10 Points)   
For the second, I did another crypto challenge titled "You Can Do It". The zip for this challenge contained one text file with the characters "YHAOANUTDSYOEOIEUTTC!" and the instructions to decipher this text.   

Originally I thought it may be another ROT13 enrypted string, but when I put it into the website I used earlier, gibberish was returned. This challenge was only worth 10 points and many people deemed it easy, but I was stuck. Since the name of the file was you can do it, I figured I would try to find that phrase in the string, using a pen and paper.   

Since there was only one 'C', I started there and moved right, looping around the end, to see if I could make the word 'CAN', and from there see if I could make 'DO', and so on. I found every third letter would give the right letter to make the next word.   

I was able to make the phrase starting from the end of the string. I thought I would need to append to this phrase, so I tried using the same technique using the remaining letters. I should note, I found the word 'YOU' at the start of the string, and then skipped to the back to get the 'CAN'. This distracted me as I was left with the letters 'HATSYEOEUT'. After some time rearranging I was able to come up with the phrase 'THATYOUSEE'.   

I tried this as the flag and it was rejected. I decided to rewrite the entire string and start looking for the two phrases. Again, I thought the string needed to start with 'YOUCANDOIT'. I found the word 'YOU' near the end, and looped around to find the correct second half 'YOUSEETHAT'. I tried inputting the flag as 'YOUCANDOITYOUSEETHAT!' but was unsuccessful. I realized 'YOUSEETHAT' is found, using the pattern discussed earlier, from the beginning of the string and came to find the correct flag was 'YOUSEETHATYOUCANDOIT!' With that, another challenge was completed.

   Here the flag is input.

   Two challenges down, one to go.

### Challenge Three: Lernaean (Web, 20 Points)   
The last, and most challenging of the three, was the Lernaean web challenge. For this challenge, HackTheBox creates a web instance with an insecure login. I was tasked with guessing the password and logging in. To start I search the term Lernaean, to learn that it references the Hydra of Greek Mythology.   
   [![hydra](/CS373/assets/lernaean/hydra.png?raw=true "Lernaean Hydra")](/CS373/assets/lernaean/hydra.png?raw=true)

   Since the instructions said to guess, I tried variations of figured related to the mytho but was unable to login. I realized I would probably need to brute force the login and stumbled upon [this](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hack-like-pro-crack-passwords-part-1-principles-technologies-0156136/) site that outlines various tools to do so. Interestingly enough, I ran across [THC-Hydra](https://tools.kali.org/password-attacks/hydra) which is a tool just for this purpose. I started to feel like I was on the right path.


After reading through the Hydra page at Kali's site, I realized I would need the parameters the site used for the POST method for logging in. To gain this information, I looked at Kali's tools and found I could use [Burp Suite](https://tools.kali.org/web-applications/burpsuite) which is used for web security purposes. I setup Firefox to use a proxy on localhost so Burp Suite could intercept requests and find the parameters needed.

   Using this tool I found the parameter I was looking for was simply 'password'.
