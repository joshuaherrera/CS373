# CS373 Final Writeup   

### Introduction   
We've reached the end of the course and it is now time for the final. Unlike other classes where students do some form of standardized testing, we get the opportunity to put what we've learned in this class to the test by completing some challenges from the site [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/). HackTheBox is a site used for testing one's penetration testing skills. For the final, we needed to complete a minimum of three challenges, achieving a score of 50 points or more. I ended up doing two stenography challenges and one web challenge to achieve the 50 points. However, to get to that point, I needed to generate an invite code.   
### Generating An Invite
When I tried signing up, I realized that it would not be as easy as providing an email and password. Since the site centers around penetration testing, potential users are encouraged to hack their way into the site.   
As I looked through the Chrome Developer Tools, I found an invite javascript file.   
<!-- [![alt text](image link)](web link) -->
   
   [![invite](/CS373/assets/invite_code/inviteapi.png?raw=true "Invite API")](/CS373/assets/invite_code/inviteapi.png?raw=true)   
   
   Looking through that file, I found a function name, makeInviteCode. Calling this from the console yielded a ROT13 encrypted string. This type of encryption rotates each letters 13 characters from it's current position. It seems like I would need to decode this.   
   
   [![invite](/CS373/assets/invite_code/makeinvitecode.png?raw=true "makeInviteCode()")](/CS373/assets/invite_code/makeinvitecode.png?raw=true)   

Luckily there are sites online that can be used to decrypt such messages. When I put the text into such a site, I found I would need to make a POST request to the site to generate a code.   
   
   [![rot13](/CS373/assets/invite_code/rot13.png?raw=true "ROT13")](/CS373/assets/invite_code/rot13.png?raw=true)   

I used a Chrome app called ARC that was used in the databases class, CS340. With this I was able to generate a new code, however, this code was also encoded in what looked to be base64.   
   
   [![post](/CS373/assets/invite_code/post.png?raw=true "POST call")](/CS373/assets/invite_code/post.png?raw=true)   

Following the decryption of this code, again using an online site, I was able to generate an invite code and create an account.   
   
   [![decoded](/CS373/assets/invite_code/decode.png?raw=true "Decoded Invite")](/CS373/assets/invite_code/decode.png?raw=true)   

### The System Environment   
Before I begin talking about the actual challenges, I'd like to take a moment and speak about the environment I did the challenges on. Normally, I do most of my development on my laptop which has both Windows 10 and Linux Mint dual booted, but HackTheBox recommends creating a virtual machine for the content on there. Therefore, I created a virtual machine using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), mainly because I ran into issues attempting to install VMWare. Once I had this installed, I proceeded to download a copy of [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/), specifically, an image already prepared for use with VirtualBox. For those unaware, Kali is a Linux distribution with many penetration testing applications already installed. It is, arguably, the standard when it comes to penetration testing distributions. With these things installed, I was ready to attempt the challenges.   

### Challenge One: You Can Do It (Stenography)
