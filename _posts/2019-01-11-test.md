# Week 1

This week was the classes introduction to malware, what exactly it is, how it effects users, and ways of detecting it.  
**What is malware**  
Malware is the concatenation of "malicious" and "software". This gives one an idea of it's purpose. It is intended to harm the user in some way. For example, keyloggers are a type of malware that logs the users keypresses with the intention of stealing sensitive data.  
Malware is created by different groups, the biggest creators being state-sponsored groups and organized crime. Reasons for malware vary, but it is usually for monetary or political gain.  
**Anti-malware**  
Due to these circumstances, anti-malware research is ongoing to combat malware and it's associated risks. The role of an anti-malware researcher is to understand and describe a threat as well as develop countermeasures to malware. Countermeasures usually come in three flavors: stop-gap, mid-term, and long-term. Each describe the time frame of a solutions effectiveness. For example, a stop-gap is meant to be a quick solution to some malware, albeit at the cost of longevity. It is more likely to be worked around by malware creators than if a long-term countermeasure were developed.  
**Types of malware**  
Malware come in different flavors. Viruses are designed to spread from host to host and replicate itself. A virus may be parasitic, in that it depends on other files, and it may also be polymorphic, meaning the code can change, which makes it harder to detect. A worm is a type of virus that spreads quickly.  
Trojans are a class of malware that are designed to give a malicious actor access to an infected machine. This can be done through backdoors, keyloggers, password stealers or bots.  
There are also potentially unwanted programs that are unwanted tools usually bundled with some software installer.
